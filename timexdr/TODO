Major stuff:
	- Find out how to chose data profiles on the GPS unit in order
	to receive not only speed+distance but also geographical position,
	heading and altitude. If you know a solution or a hint, please 
	drop me an email.
Minor:
	- More command line options to allow finer control of the output.
