1. WHAT IS IT?
--------------

timexdr is a userspace control utility for Timex Data Recorder. It 
downloads heart rate monitor (HRM) and position (GPS) data from the
device.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

You will need libusb shared libraries installed.

The program has been tested with linux kernel 2.6.10 and libusb 0.1.10a.

usbfs has to be mounted (and of course compiled into the kernel).

3. INSTALLATION
---------------

The installation steps:

	make
	make install

timexdr needs a write access to /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD where BBB is the
USB bus number and DDD device number of the attached device. BBB and DDD
can change every time the device is attached to the USB port. Therefore,
you shouldn't rely on the BBB and DDD numbers. You can either allow write 
access to all devices on usbfs file system or set the setuid-bit of timexdr.
Please let me know if you know about a better solution.

4. USAGE
--------

See the manual page:

	man timexdr
