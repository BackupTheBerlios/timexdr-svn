1. WHAT IS IT?
--------------

timexdr is a userspace control utility for Timex Data Recorder. It 
downloads heart rate monitor (HRM) and position (GPS) data from the
device.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

You will need libusb shared libraries installed.

The program has been tested with linux kernel 2.6.10 and libusb 0.1.10a.

You will need udev configured or mounted usbfs. If both udev and usbfs are
present on the system, udev device nodes are used by timexdr.

3. INSTALLATION
---------------

The installation steps:

	./configure
	make
	make install

timexdr needs a write access to /dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD or /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD,
depending whether udev or usbfs is used. BBB is the USB bus number and DDD 
device number of the attached device. BBB and DDD can change every time the 
device is attached to the USB port. Therefore, you shouldn't rely on the BBB 
and DDD numbers. Timexdr is installed SETUID to make sure it can initialize
the device and the root privileges are dropped immediately after that.

4. USAGE
--------

See the manual page:

	man timexdr

If you are wondering how do you plot the data, you are on your own for now
although many utilities exist that could help you to display the data. 
As a part of the source package, you will find a script plot_session.gri 
which creates a Postscript file showing your excersise data. This script 
requires GRI plotting language to be installed (homepage is 
http://gri.sourceforge.net).

To plot your HRM and GPS session use the following command:

	gri plot_session.gri 20050411_081000-090000.hrm 20050411_081000-090000.gps

Substitute files 20050411_081000-090000.{gps,hrm} with your own recorded 
sessions. The Postscript image will now be stored in the file plot_session.ps.
