1. WHAT IS IT?
--------------

timexdr is a userspace control utility for Timex Data Recorder. It 
downloads heart rate monitor (HRM) and position (GPS) data from the
device.

2. REQUIREMENTS
---------------

You will need libusb shared libraries installed.

The program has been tested with linux kernel 2.6.10 and libusb 0.1.10a.

You will need udev configured or mounted usbfs. If both udev and usbfs are
present on the system, udev device nodes are used by timexdr.

3. INSTALLATION
---------------

The installation steps:

	./configure
	make
	make install

timexdr needs a write access to /dev/bus/usb/BBB/DDD or /proc/bus/usb/BBB/DDD,
depending whether udev or usbfs is used. BBB is the USB bus number and DDD 
device number of the attached device. BBB and DDD can change every time the 
device is attached to the USB port. Therefore, you shouldn't rely on the BBB 
and DDD numbers. Timexdr can be installed SETUID to make sure it can initialize
the device and the root privileges would be dropped immediately after that.
However, it is recommended to use some means of adjusting user access to 
the device, for example udev. The followin udev rule will set access mode to
read/write for group users so anybody in that group can use timexdr:

SUBSYSTEM=="usb_device", SYSFS{product}=="Timex Data Recorder", PROGRAM="/bin/sh -c 'K=%k; K=$${K#usbdev}; printf bus/usb/%%03i/%%03i $${K%%%%.*} $${K#*.}'", NAME="%c", SYMLINK+="timexdr", MODE="0664", GROUP="users"

The rule belongs to one of the rules files in /etc/udev/rules.d/. Note that
a symbolic link /dev/timexdr is also created when the device is plugged in.

4. USAGE
--------

See the manual page:

	man timexdr

If you are wondering how do you plot the data, timexdr package provides couple
basic utilities for displaying the recorded data:

	plot_timex_data
	plot_timex_session.gri

It is recommended to use the first one because the gri script is not 
developped anymore.

The gps2gpx script converts *.gps files to the GPS Exchange Format (GPX) so the 
recorded route can be used by other applications or GPS devices. More information
about the GPX standard can be found at http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp.
