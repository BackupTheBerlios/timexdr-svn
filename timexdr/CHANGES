Version 1.0-pre1
----------------
	- I have decided to make this the first preliminary release of 
	  a stable version. The utility seems to be stable already and
	  with all core functionality implemented. However, I will give
	  it a few days/weeks of testing before releasing it as stable.	

	- Clear EEPROM functionality added.

Version 0.2
-----------
	- GPS sessions and multi-device sessions are now printed too.
	- Time synchronization added.

Version 0.1
-----------
	- First release.
	- HRM sessions printed.
	- EEPROM dumps.
