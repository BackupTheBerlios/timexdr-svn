2006-03-23  Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Modified Makefile to install the executable setuid
	* timexdr now drops root privileges immediately after device
	initialization. Thus, any data files written are now owned by the user
	running timexdr and not by root.
	* Updated man page, README.
	* Fixed a bug in plot_session.gri.

2006-03-03  Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Added function for handling GPS_PACKET_TYPE=15 which provides
	complete set of navigation data.
	* Modified Makefile to install the executable setuid

2006-02-24  Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Version 1.14
	* Added option --eeprom-dump=full versus --eeprom-dump to allow for
	dumping of the EEPROM content only or of all information received in
	the packects (full).
	* Final modifications and test of the installation process on MacOS.
	

2006-02-22  Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Moved the installation process from using plain Makefile to
	autotools (autoconf, automake,...)
	* Rewritten the code due to improved understanding of the Timex
	Data Recorder control commands
	* Better reporting of several verbosity levels, new command line
	option -v|--verbose.
	* Added command line option -V|--version.
	* Modified to install and work on Darwin or MacOS 10.
	* Bumped to version 1.10.

2005-04-14  Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Version 1.0
	* Added options -d and -f. The former option enables download of
	sessions recorded within specified number of days only while the
	second option makes timexdr to write the session data in file(s)
	YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS-HHMMSS.{gps,hrm}.

2005-04-11  Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Version 1.0-pre2
	* Set default units to SI units (kilometers).
	* Option -m|--miles for switching between SI and imperial units.
	* Corrected ODO_MAX to 4.096 miles so the distance counter can actually 	display distances greater than 4.096 miles.

2005-04-02 Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Version 1.0-pre1
	* I have decided to make this the first preliminary release of 
	  a stable version. The utility seems to be stable already and
	  with all core functionality implemented. However, I will give
	  it a few days/weeks of testing before releasing it as stable.	
	* Clear EEPROM functionality added.

2005-03-31 Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Version 0.2
	* GPS sessions and multi-device sessions are now printed too.
	* Time synchronization added.

2005-03-29 Jan Merka <merka@highsphere.net>
	* Version 0.1
	* First release.
	* HRM sessions printed.
	* EEPROM dumps.
